  <string name="prefs_not_readable_description"><![CDATA[
        Xposed can\'t read the preference file of this module, default values will be used in hooks.
        There are several ways to fix this problem. Also note that this error pops up if you\'ve never
        opened the app before.<br><br>
        First, reboot the device (No soft reboot!).<br>
        If that doesn\'t help, try reinstalling the module.<br>
        If both attempts fail, ensure that your SELinux mode is set to <i>permissive</i>.
        <i>Enforcing</i> SELinux might block access to the preference file. In order to change the mode,
        use the app <tt>SELinuxModeChanger</tt> that you can download
        <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2524485">in this XDA thread</a>.<br>
        If even that fails, you probably have to live with the default values, sorry :(
