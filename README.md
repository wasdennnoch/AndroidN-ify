### Viperus Notes

### You are welcome to use my modified version and feel free to make it better
I am currently looking into the devs recent changes and seeing where i can help
My Git might not be as current (always will be on the latest build) becuase i do this as a hobby but feel free to use it snd expect updates after every change few changes i make... Hoping i can expand on the idea of making notification center look like N

### For those looking to compile this for yourself:
1. Download Java SE (preverably 8 which can be found here: http://goo.gl/X68FzJ)
2. Download Android Studio (availiable for windows right here: http://goo.gl/87bZIx)
3. Open Android Studio and import the project
4. In the toolbar click build then build APK
